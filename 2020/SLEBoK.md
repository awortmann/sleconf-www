The Software Language Engineering Body of Knowledge (SLEBoK) is a community-wide effort to provide a unique and comprehensive description of the concepts, tools and methods developed by the SLE community.

The SLEBoK workshop is a continuation of efforts from the SLEBoK Dagstuhl Seminar of 2017, as well as earlier brainstorming events like the SL(E)BOK workshop at SLE 2012. To get more information about the workshop visit the [workshopâ€™s web page](https://2018.splashcon.org/track/slebok-2018).
